## About me
I'm a passionate individual who thrives in structured environments and loves learning new things. My curiosity drives me to explore different subjects, from the depths of fantasy novels to the intricate world of coding.

When I'm not coding or exploring new knowledge, I enjoy escaping into fantastical realms through books. Though I have a soft spot for fantasy, I also appreciate non-fiction for its ability to expand my understanding of the world. 

Beyond the digital and literary worlds, I find solace in the simple joy of cycling.

A strong sense of organization and a love for schedules help me stay focused and productive. I believe in the power of structure to achieve goals and maximize efficiency. 

If you're looking for someone who is curious, driven, and loves to learn, I'm your person.
